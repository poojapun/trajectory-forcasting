## Overview

`trajectory-forcasting` is a project focused on predicting the future trajectories of moving objects based on historical data. This can be applied in various domains such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and human motion analysis. This repo is for the CSE 251B Spring Class project, our group is Girls with Classifiers. 

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools to clean and prepare trajectory datasets.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of several trajectory forecasting models.
- **Visualization**: Visual tools to analyze and interpret predictions.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics to assess the accuracy and reliability of forecasts.
